# leaflet-challenge


Earthquake Analysis: This project used Leaflet, d3.js, and Mapbox to create a map from USGS API data on earthquakes in the last 7 days, along with GeoJSON data from a tectonic plates repo.


The earthquakes are mapped as circle markers, sized by their magnitude, and colored by their depth.


static: css (styles.css), js (logic.js: JavaScript to generate the maps), images (folder containing screenshots of map)
index.html: base html to hold the map.
